# Covid-19 Impacts Analysis
## Case Study: 
The first wave of Covid-19 affected the world economy as the world was unable to prepare for a pandemic. This led to increased cases, increased deaths, increased unemployment, and increased poverty, leading to a slowdown in the economy. This is necessary to analyze the spread of Covid-19 cases and the economic impact of Covid-19. The dataset used to analyze the impact of Covid-19 is downloaded from Kaggle. Contains data on:
1. Country Code
2. All Country Names
3. Record Date
4. Human Development Index of All Countries
5. Daily Covid-19 Cases
6. Covid-19 Daily Deaths
7. Strict Indicators of Countries
8. Country Population
9. Per capita GDP of Countries

## Conclusion
In this task, I investigated the spread of Covid-19 between countries and its impact on the world economy. With the outbreak of Covid-19, the number of cases and deaths of Covid-19 is the highest in the United States. The main reason for this is an indicator of US rigor. It is relatively small when measured against the population. I also analyzed how per capita GDP in each country was affected during the outbreak of Covid-19.
